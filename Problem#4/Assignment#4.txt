Python’s pow function returns the result of raising a number to a given power. Define a
function expo that performs this task and state its computational complexity using big-O
notation. The first argument of this function is the number, and the second argument is
the exponent (nonnegative numbers only). You may use either a loop or a recursive
function in your implementation.

Caution: do not use Python’s ** operator or pow function in this exercise, automatic 0.
