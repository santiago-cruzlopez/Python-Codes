Add three methods to the Student class from Chapter 9 that compare two Student
objects. One method should test for equality. A second method should test for less than.
The third method should test for greater than or equal to. In each case, the method
returns the result of the comparison of the two students’ names. Include a main function
that tests all of the comparison operators, then place several Student objects into a list
and shuffle it. Then run the sort method with this list and display all the students’
information.

1. Equality Method (2%).
2. Less Than Method (2%).
3. Greater Than Method (2%).
4. Main Function (4%).
