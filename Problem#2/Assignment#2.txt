Write a program that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The program
should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a list. The program
then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user
for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If
the input is the word “exit”, the program quits (think of this as a termination condition,
where have we seen that term before?). Otherwise, the program prints the line
associated with that number, and then asks for another line number.

The program should handle invalid inputs by outputting an error. There are two error
conditions, one error message should be output if the input is not an integer or the word
exit, another error message should be output if the input number is not in the expected
range of line numbers. 

You can check if a string variable x is a valid integer using the 
function x.isdigit() which returns true if x is a valid integer.
